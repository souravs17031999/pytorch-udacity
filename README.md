# pytorch-udacity
This is a repository for my progress on pytorch scholarship course on udacity.
The notebooks are not exactly same as Udacity notebook and i have created my own notebooks with modifications in each notebooks , some being slight like in lesson 2 and some being major like in lesson 4.
There are various introductory notebooks on topics like Tensors and working with tensors in Pytorch and various other topics will be added as i learn them.
