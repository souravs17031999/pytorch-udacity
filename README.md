# PyTorch-Udacity
This is a repository for my progress on pytorch scholarship course on udacity.
The notebooks are not exactly same as Udacity notebook and i have created my own notebooks with modifications in each notebooks , some being slight like in lesson 2 and some being major like in lesson 4.
There are various introductory notebooks on topics like Tensors and working with tensors in Pytorch and various other topics will be added as i learn them.
link to udacity notebook - https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch
and link to course - https://in.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188
and other resources which are really helpful to learn are -

Two problems solved till now :
* MNIST HANDWRITTEN DIGITS DATASET CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM - IN THIS WE ARE GIVEN 28\*28 GREY SCALE HANDWRITTEN IMAGES , 64 EXAMPLES AND WE ARE REQUIRED TO PREDICT THE DIGIT CORRECTLY BY FIRING AND ACTIVATING ONE OF THE NEURONS IN THE OUTPUT LAYER.
INPUT- 1 LAYER CONTAINING 784 NEURONS 
TWO HIDDEN LAYERS
ONE OUTPUT LAYER CONTAINING 10 NEURONS

* FASHION-MNIST DATASET CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM - IN THIS WE ARE GIVEN 28\*28 GERY SCALE FASHION CLOTHING IMAGES , 64 EXAMPLES AND WE ARE REQUIRED TO CORRECTLY CLASSIFY AS ONE OF THE 10 CLASSES (ANKIE BOOT , BAGS , SHIRTS , TROUSERS ETC...).
INPUT- 1 LAYER CONTAINING 784 NEURONS
1 HIDDEN LAYER CONTAINING 256 NEURONS
1 OUTPUT LAYER CONTAINING 10 NEURONS.
